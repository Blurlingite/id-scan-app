### You may install the Expo Go extensions in Visual Studio Code to use npx

### Also install node.js to do npm commands https://nodejs.org/en/

### Do not forget to npm install and npm audit fix after cloning and pulling!

### npx expo start, or npm start if you did not download npx, is the command to start the app.

### If you cannot connect your device to expo go, try doing npx expo start --clear to clear cache and make sure the WI-FI is the same for both the debug phone and the computer with VS Code

### If it still does not work, try tunneling it with npx expo start --tunnel
